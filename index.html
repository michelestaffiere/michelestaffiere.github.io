            <div id="my-story">
               <p> My passion for technology dates back to my childhood. My father worked in networking and was responsible for installing server-grade equipment
                in the 90s to mid 2000s before deciding that a career in tech was no longer for him. During this time, I often had the opportunity to walk around 
                commercial-grade server rooms when there was no one available to babysit me. This sparked my interest and passion for tech.
                In my teenage years, I enjoyed building custom machines for my friends so we could all play games together. I became known as the "tech guy" in my 
                friend group and was frequently asked questions about PC hardware. I even got a job at a local computer hardware store to be closer to the latest and greatest tech atthe time. 
                Few years later, after a couple of attempts at attending college, I finally graduated with a diploma in HR. This was a departure from my true passion, but I remained determined
                 to break into the tech field. I began teaching myself how to code by learning web development, which I found to be a great entry point for beginners like myself due to low skill floor and high skill
                ceiling that allows for near endless possibilities.
                Despite struggling with math and logic-based questions in the past, I believe that anyone can learn how to code. I invite you to join me on this journey and take a look around my page. Feel free to
                contact me using the form provided. This page will receive regular updates until I am fully employed in the field and no longer have time for smaller portfolio projects. Even then, this page may transform into 
                something else as I continue to pursue my passion.</p>
