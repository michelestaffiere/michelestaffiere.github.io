        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <div id="story-container">
            <div id="my-story">
               <p>My passion for tech dates back to my childhood, when my father worked in networking and I had the opportunity to explore commercial-grade server rooms. My father installed server-grade equipment in the 90s to mid 2000s before deciding to leave the tech industry. His work sparked my interest and led me to become known as the "tech guy" among my friends, frequently answering questions about PC hardware, building multiple high-end systems for gaming and production purposes. I eventually got a job at a local computer hardware store just to be closer to the tech world. Despite struggling with math and logic in the past, I began teaching myself how to code once I realized what I studied in college wasn't what I wanted to do with my life. Ultimately, I started with web development simply because it had the lowest bar for entry and was something I found fun to tinker with. I strongly believe anyone can learn to code with enough dedication and the right mindset, and I'm inviting you to join me on this journey. My page will receive regular updates until I am fully employed in the tech field, and it may transform into something else as I continue to pursue my passion.</p>
