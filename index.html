            <div id="my-story">
               <p>My passion for tech dates back to my childhood, when my father worked in networking and I had the opportunity to explore commercial-grade server rooms.
                  My father installed server-grade equipment in the 90s to mid 2000s before deciding to leave the tech industry. His work sparked my interest and led me to become
                  known as the "tech guy" among my friends, frequently answering questions about PC hardware. I eventually got a job at a local computer hardware store and began
                  and later began teaching myself how to code once i realized what i studied in college wasn't what i wanted to do with my life. Starting with web development, Despite struggling with math and logic in the past,
                  I believe anyone can learn to code and invite you to join me on this journey. 
                  My page will receive regular updates until I am fully employed in the tech field and may transform into something else as I continue to pursue my passion.</p>
